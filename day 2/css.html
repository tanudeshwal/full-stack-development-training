                <p style="background-color: aqua;">We live in a world that moves fast—notifications buzzing, deadlines approaching, and the constant
                    pressure to “keep up.” But lately, I’ve found myself wondering: what’s the rush?

                <p style="background-color: aqua;">I started making small changes. Putting my phone on silent during meals. Walking instead of driving
                    short distances. Saying “no” to things that don’t bring me peace. And guess what? Life didn’t fall
                    apart. In fact, it started to feel a little fuller, a little quieter, and a lot more mine.

                        Slowing down doesn’t mean falling behind. It means living with intention. It’s not always easy,
                        but it’s worth it.Want this blog to be about a specific topic (like travel, food, mental health,
                        tech, etc.)

                    <h2>The comfort of little things</h2>
                    <p>In a world that moves fast, where headlines scream urgency and social media feeds overflow with
                        noise, it's easy to overlook the quiet comfort found in life's simplest moments. Yet, often, it
                        is not the grand achievements or dramatic milestones that bring us true peace—but the little
                        things. The unnoticed. The everyday. The gentle.
